## Topic
2016 US presidential election

## Research Question
Do individuals from the Southern regions of the United States exhibit a higher tendency to vote for Republicans compared to those from the Northern regions?

Furthermore, a reflection of the RQ could be made based on the research question. For example: the cultural difference between the South and the North of U.S may cause American people's party election tendency.
